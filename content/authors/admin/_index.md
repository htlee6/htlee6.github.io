 My name ÊùéÊòäÂ§© is interpreted as Haotian Li in English where Êùé(l«ê) is my family name and Êòä(h√†o)Â§©(tiƒÅn) is my given name.

 At the moment I am a graduate student in System Science at Beijing Normal University and a member of [BrainAIR](http://www.brainair.cn) Lab, advised by [Prof. Bailu Si](https://sss.bnu.edu.cn/tabid/143/ArticleID/462/frtid/144/Default.aspx). Just finished my exchange year at Ludwig-Maximillians-Universit√§t M√ºnchen (University of Munich), majoring Computer Science. I obtained my bachelor's degree of engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
