 My name ÊùéÊòäÂ§© is interpreted as Haotian Li in English where Êùé(l«ê) is my family name and Êòä(h√†o)Â§©(tiƒÅn) is my given name.

 I will join the [Algorithmic Data Analysis Group](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/ai-data-science/algorithmic-data-analysis) at Utrecht University as a PhD student this fall.
 I am interested in machine learning and deep learning, especially in graph and network analysis and motivated to convert machine learning techniques to real-world applications.
 Received my M.Sc from Beijing Normal University and B.Eng from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
 Spent 1 year studying at Ludwig-Maximillians-Universit√§t M√ºnchen as an exchange student, Munich is a great place to live.

 Feel free to connect and reach out! üòÑ
